# Customer-Purchase-Behaviour

    Introduction :

Customer Purchase Behavior Analytics is a data visualization and analysis project designed to understand how customers interact with a business through their purchases, demographic characteristics, engagement level, and online behavior. Using a 500,000-record dataset, this project aims to uncover actionable insights that support marketing strategies, customer segmentation, business growth, and sales optimization.
Tableau is used to clean, prepare, analyze, and visualize the dataset. With interactive dashboards, stakeholders can track purchasing trends, understand customer satisfaction, evaluate product category performance, and examine behavior patterns across regions and segments.
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of how different factors—such as age, income, product preferences, time spent on the website, discounts availed, loyalty membership, and customer segments—shape overall purchase behavior.
 
Scenario 1: Marketing Strategy Optimization

In this Scenario, Marketing teams can use Tableau insights to find which customer segments purchase the most, which regions perform well, and which product categories need more promotion. By analyzing customer demographics and engagement metrics such as time spent on the website, referral sources, and discounts availed, marketers can design targeted campaigns. Insights help identify high-value customers, loyal segments, and customer groups that require retention strategies.

Scenario 2: Customer Experience & Satisfaction Analysis

In this Scenario,Customer satisfaction scores, session counts, tenure, and purchase history allow companies to study how customer experience influences purchases. Tableau dashboards highlight patterns in satisfaction across customer segments like VIP, Premium, and Regular customers. Businesses can detect areas where customer experience is declining and address issues through improved service quality, personalized offers, and loyalty initiatives.

Scenario 3: Product & Revenue Optimization

Sales and product teams can use visualizations to understand top-performing product categories, customer device preferences, and repeat-purchase behavior. Tableau insights allow comparison of Electronics, Furniture, and other product lines, helping identify high-demand categories. Real-time views of purchase status and frequency help optimize inventory, pricing strategy, and product forecasting.
